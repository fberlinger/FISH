# Turing Fish

You can learn the behavior of fish given an ideal model.

- To execute learning, run run_trial_distributed.py. You may want to change the name of outputted files containing learned results.

- To see a learned replica, use the test_learned_fish notebook

- In the aggregation, dispersion-success, and radii-vel folders are interesting results from prior experiments. The experiment.md file in each folder explains the conditions used to run trials in that folder.
