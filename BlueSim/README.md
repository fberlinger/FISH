# BlueSim

Bla bla Project Explanation

## Run

Open the jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

and within that notebook open one of the following files ending in `.ipynb`:

- `exp1.ipynb`
- `exp2.ipynb`

Please run each cell individually! **Warning**: Using `Run All` will not work
as the experiments start several threads for every fish and the code execution
async, hence, Jupyter Notebook runs new cells to quickly before others finished.
